# example-unmaintainable-app

An app for teaching maintainability. Badly written on purpose.

I even went in and broke code formatting and conventions to trigger lint...

## TODO
in no particular order

### Configurations
- install eslint and add linting to test
- check code coverage

### Fixing, refactoring
- cover with tests for safe refactoring
- add error handling
- make app more testable

### Maintenance tasks
- remove code duplication
- split code into more modules
- add logging to understand app state better
